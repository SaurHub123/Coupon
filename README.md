# Coupon
This Flutter project is a simple Coupon Code app that showcases different offers and allows users to interact with them. It uses a `StatefulWidget` to dynamically fetch coupon data and display it in a visually appealing manner. The app includes a list of coupons with details such as the offer code, description, and terms.
